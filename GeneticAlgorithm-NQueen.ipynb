    "The NQueen problem:\\\n",
    "As prof.BabaAli has taught in class, in order to solve any problem with a genetic algorithm we must first find an optimal way to show the answers to the problem as chromosomes.\\\n",
    "As discussed in class, we define the chromosomes as a $1$-dimensional array of length n (assuming that the board is $n*n$). This is because we can be sure that when we want to place $n$ queens in an $n$ by $n$ table, since there can only and only be a single queen in each column (note that the count of the queens and the size of the table both match - $n$). As a result, we shall only have one metric for each column's queen: what row that queen is located in.\\\n",

However, we want to make the fitness give a higher score when the solution is more optimal, thus we invert the asnwers by substracting them from the +inf. we can also define +inf as the maximum score available in the problem (with some extra addition for good measure).\\\n",
